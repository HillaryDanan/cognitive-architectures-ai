# Cognitive Architectures for AI Systems
*Exploring how cognitive diversity creates computational advantages*

## Overview

This research program investigates how different cognitive architectures (neurotypical, autism, ADHD) represent alternative computational strategies that can enhance AI system design. Through mathematical frameworks and interactive visualizations, we demonstrate that neurodiversity is not a limitation but a source of computational innovation.

## Core Thesis

Different minds achieve identical outcomes through different dimensional organizations of self and time. By understanding these patterns mathematically, we can build AI systems that leverage cognitive diversity for robustness, adaptability, and innovation.

## Research Frameworks

  - Foundation for TIDE-resonance trust dynamics

## Key Insights

1. **Dimensional Reorganization**: What appears as "deficit" is often efficient reorganization
2. **Trust Dynamics**: Different architectures build trust through different pathways
3. **Sensory Resonance**: Each architecture resonates with different environmental patterns
4. **Complementary Processing**: Diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones

## Applications

### For AI Systems:
- Design architectures that match task requirements
- Build robust systems through architectural diversity
- Create interpretable AI through dimensional frameworks

### For Human Understanding:
- Visualize how different minds process information
- Design inclusive technologies
