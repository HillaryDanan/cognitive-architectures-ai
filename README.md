# Cognitive Architectures for AI Systems
*Exploring how cognitive diversity creates computational advantages*

## Overview

This research program investigates how different cognitive architectures (neurotypical, autism, ADHD) represent alternative computational strategies that can enhance AI system design. Through mathematical frameworks and interactive visualizations, we demonstrate that neurodiversity is not a limitation but a source of computational innovation.

## Core Thesis

Different minds achieve identical outcomes through different dimensional organizations of self and time. By understanding these patterns mathematically, we can build AI systems that leverage cognitive diversity for robustness, adaptability, and innovation.

## Key Insights

1. **Dimensional Reorganization**: What appears as "deficit" is often efficient reorganization
2. **Trust Dynamics**: Different architectures build trust through different pathways
3. **Sensory Resonance**: Each architecture resonates with different environmental patterns
4. **Complementary Processing**: Diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones

## Applications
